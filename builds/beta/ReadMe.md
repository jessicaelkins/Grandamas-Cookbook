In the beta build for Grandmas Cookbook, the program itself will take you through the different sections of the application starting from the main menu. From the main menu you can choose to add a recipe OR you can choose from the different recipe types and search through the various recipes in those categories! (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert)
